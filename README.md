## Past branch
The idea here is for each boid to imitate the past velocity and position of other boids. This implementation was inspired by the behavior of ants: each boid leaves a "chemical trail" that holds information on the position and velocity of the boid at any given time. When a boid sees part of a "chemical trail" it starts to copy the position and velocity information left behind by the boid making the trail. On this branch, boids have not only a limited view range, but also a limited field of view (boids only see things in front of them). As one might expect, this implementation results in ant-like behavior. The boids slowly converge onto distinct paths, and these paths evolve over time. Sometimes bends in the path shift, sometimes the path breaks (the "chemical trails" eventually expire), and in general the paths smooth themselves out over time.
